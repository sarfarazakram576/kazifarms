                University <a href="https://www.cwu.edu.bd/" target="_blank">(www.cwu.edu.bd)</a>, the first private
                university for
                women in Bangladesh.</p>
            <p class="margin">Kazi Farms Group also contributes to the operation of Kazi Zahural Huq College
                <a href="https://www.kzhcollege.edu.bd/" target="_blank">(kzhcollege.edu.bd)</a> in Mary Gopinathpur,

                is the home district of the Managing Director,
                Kazi Zahedul Hasan. This is a free privately-managed HSC college with one of the highest pass rates of
                the district.
            </p>
            <p class="margin">Kazi Farms Group is donating 15 crore Taka for the construction of a new conference centre
                at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, where founder Kazi Zahedul Hasan studied and
                taught . <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHC3xIO94V0"

            </p>
            <p class="margin">Kazi Farms Group donated 1.9 acres of land in Gazipur to Utsho
                <a href="https://utshobangladesh.org/about-utsho-bangladesh/presentation/"
                    target="_blank">(https://www.utshobangladesh.org/about-utsho-bangladesh/presentation/)</a>
                in 2003 for construction of a
                permanent residential school for underprivileged children.
            </p>
            <p class="margin">SDGs for Bangladesh aim to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, modern energy
                services and increase the substantial share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. Kazi
                Farms Group established solar plants at several of its subsidiaries to achieve the SDG goal and reduce
                the carbon footprint to protect the environment. Considering the obstacle to getting free land for solar
                plants, the group has initially installed solar plants on unused land, terraces, and rooftops of its
                seven subsidiaries. The total capacity of these plants is around 3MW, and they generate about 12500kWhr
                electricity per day. After meeting the requirements, about 20% of electricity is exported to the grid
                through a net meter. To meet the massive demand for electricity in the country in a sustainable manner,
                KFG wants to set up rooftop solar plants on its other farms, hatcheries, feed mills and factories in
                phase and intends to install 20MW or even more solar plants eventually.
